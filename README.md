# tournio-web-client

This is the code for the frontend of my registration system for IGBO bowling tournaments. The repository for the backend is at `tournio-api`.

This was built using Create Next App.

## Main Frameworks

It's a React app built to run on [NextJS](https://nextjs.org).

I endeavor to be on the latest versions of the language and framework. As such, you can expect to see frequent updates for React, NextJS, Boostrap, and all the other libraries it uses.

## Dependencies

The main libraries used in this system are:
- NextJS
- React
- Bootstrap
- Axios

## More to come

As I flesh this out...
